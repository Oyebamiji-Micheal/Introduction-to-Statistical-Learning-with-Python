## About this repository 
<p align="justify">
    The main objective of this repository is to serve as my personal learning log, where I document my progress, insights, and solutions as I work through the book's exercises. As I tackle both conceptual and applied questions, I aim to strengthen and reinforce my statistical intuition and improve my proficiency in applying statistical learning techniques with Python.
